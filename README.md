### Engineering preview!
### No binary builds yet - Early beta!

### Intro
Welcome! This is the code of Fusion Engine, a 2D and 3D engine forked from the Godot Engine. 
The idea is to have an ultra performant game engine, capable of running on a potato. 
Including support for many platforms. 
Fusion Engine is based on Godot 1.0, with new features and fixed bugs.

### Building
Get scons and python, choose a platform from the platform directory and then run 
`scons platform=name target=release tools=no -j8` (Replace "name" with the desired platform).
Every console port uses the open source homebrew sdk.

### Making a game
Make a game in the editor.
The editor is unusual if you are familiar with godot, but you'll be able to notice it's very intuitive after learning it. 
Games can range from 3D to 2D to apps. 
The main focus point of the engine has been the 3D part so far.

### Running a game
For all platforms so far, it's as simple as copying the data.pck (or project directory) into the same folder as the fusion engine binary.
